# NumericalMethods
Coursework from numerical methods classes I took.
/NM2 Project Files and /NM3 Project Files contain inidividual Python scripts for the projects I worked on which includes the numerical methods and code for graphing.
/Project Reports contains all the project reports which explains the methods, compares them, and shows images of the results

The base directory Python files contain unique implementations of each method I used in the project files (since many were duplicated thorughout them)
